# Is it really harder to do it on a cold rainy night in Stoke?

_What is the meaning of 'can they do it on a cold rainy night in Stoke'?
The expression was made famous by commentator Andy Gray, who was discussing a Manchester City vs Everton game in 2010-11 with Richard Keys._

_Keys brought up the subject of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, who at the time were still dominating European football and had been nominated for the 2010 Ballon d'Or._

_"He would struggle on a cold night at the Britannia Stadium," the ex-Aston Villa forward told presenter Keys._

_The Argentina striker was in particular at the peak of his Barcelona heyday under the management of Pep Guardiola, a talisman in Blaugrana colours._
